This man loves music 2. He is the most consistently pleasant, happy person to be around. Hungover? Andy’s an angel. Hangry? He’s still nice though. Stressed at work? Andy’s giggling. All in, this is why I picked this song for him . It’s all about dancing through sadness and loving it, even if the song playing is depressing and slow. At the end of the day, I think it’s a lesson we all should try to learn from Mr. Hawkins - sometimes life sucks, but turn on a good song and smile through it, because that experience is what life’s all about.

You stop in your tracks. The busker is a beam of light. Something inside of you stirs. Surprising yourself, you chant: ""Ingonyama nengw' enambala."" First softly, then stronger. Passersby join in - the hotdog man, a bike courier. The sound swells! The busker catches your eye. You nod. Traffic still, you step into the street and sing: ""From the day we arrive on the planet ..."" The song flows from deep inside. Tears of joy stream down your face. You sing! You sing and the city sings with you! It ends as suddenly as it began. The street is as it was, people disperse. Your heart is pounding and you're a mess, but you feel utterly full.
